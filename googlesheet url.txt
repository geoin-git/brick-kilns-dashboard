Works fine.  changes to be made: 1. default basemap should be google map, then google earth, than openstreet map. 2. Add Gis based fucntions like, a button to reset the extent of the map to the original, name it home. 3. another buttons suggestions, place them down to zoom in zoom out. make the button panel a bit transparent to look good.
